# Data-Visualization for feature engineering
In order to build a ML model to predict individuals with income greater than 50K per year, the purpose of this project is finding all features that can contribute to improve the accuracy of the model. 
This project will use data visualization techniques to compare data between two groups: >50K and <=50K. The visualization will show which features should be used in the ML model.
